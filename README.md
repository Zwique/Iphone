# Brute-Forcing the Passcode

To solve this challenge, the goal is to try all possible 4-digit passcodes (from 0000 to 9999) until we find the correct one. Since there are only 10,000 possible combinations for a 4-digit number, a brute-force attack is feasible within a reasonable amount of time.

```
python3 slv.py
```
It takes quite a long time. However, in the end, we'll receive both the correct password and the flag.
